Servlet Basics
=================================================

These demos illustrate basic concepts related to Java servlets using embedded Jetty.

## Library Setup ##

This project has two additional third-party libraries setup in the [pom.xml](pom.xml) file. The first are the **Jetty** and servlet libraries required for these examples. There are also a few optional Apache libraries included: the Apache Log4j2 library, the [Apache Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/) library, and the [Apache Commons Text](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/) library.
